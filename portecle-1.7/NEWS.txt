---------------------------------

New features:
- Support for importing key pairs from OpenSSL PEM bundles.
- Support for encrypting private key in PEM export.
- Recognition and decoding support for some additional certificate
  extensions.

  default values in forms, and improved extension viewer dialog with hyperlink
  support for other resources in them (CRLs, certificates etc).

  installing them.

New in Portecle 1.3 (2007-12-16):
---------------------------------

New features:
- Support for deleting key-only keystore entries.
- Support for cloning certificate keystore entries.
- Support for case sensitive JKS keystores.
- Support for RSA certificates using the RIPEMD128withRSA and
  RIPEMD256withRSA signature algorithms.

Enhancements:
- Add "cacerts" to list of filenames to accept when selecting JKS
  keystores.
- Use xdg-open for opening URLs on non-Windows/Mac platforms.
  http://portland.freedesktop.org/wiki/XdgUtils
- Include Freedesktop.org menu entry.
- Allow per entry selection of overwritten entries in keystore conversion.
- Spelling fixes.

Bug fixes:
- When overwriting an existing entry while creating a new key pair, cloning
  an existing one, or importing one, canceling the operation when asked for
  a password for the new entry would already have deleted the entry that was
  about to be overwritten.
- Closing various confirmation dialog windows without clicking any of the
  regular option buttons had the same effect as clicking "Yes".
- Fix dialog thread deadlock issues.

Miscellaneous:
- Do not make any internal assumptions about keystore alias case sensitivity.
- Bundled Bouncy Castle provider jar upgraded to 1.38, which is also the
  new minimum required version.  This makes treatment of PKCS#12 keystore
  aliases case insensitive.
